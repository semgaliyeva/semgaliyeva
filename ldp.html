					As a student of LCC International University, I had a chance to participate in LDP Program where I have chosen to be an Resident Assistant.
					<br>
					As the Resident Assistant for 5th East, Neumann Hall, I’ve organized a range of events to build a strong, supportive community for the girls on the floor. It includes the hosting fun activities like Apple Pie Night, Board Game Nights, and Karaoke. Also, to more casual events like passing cookies.
					<br>
					My aim was to create a welcoming environment where everyone feels connected. These experiences have helped foster friendships and made our floor feel like a home away from home.

					The best part of being a Resident Assistant on the 5th East girls' floor in Neumann Hall has been meeting new people and developing crucial leadership skills. 
					<br>
					This role has allowed me to hone my organizational abilities, improve my public speaking,and learn how to handle various challenges that come with fostering a strong community.
					<br>
					In addition to my daily responsibilities, I’ve participated in numerous training sessions and the Leadership Development Program (LDP), which are designed to deepen our understanding of leadership and allow us to practice these skills in real-life scenarios. 
					<br>
					 As an RA for first-year students, I’ve had the chance to guide and inspire them during the very beginning of their college journey. It’s a privilege to help them adjust to campus life, find their place in the community,
					 <br>
					 and offer support as they take their first steps toward independence. Watching them grow and develop has made this experience especially meaningful.
					 <br>
					 These sessions have been instrumental in shaping me as a leader and equipping me with tools to be more effective in my role.One of the most fulfilling parts of my experience has been working with freshman students.
